            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Initial Cleaning &amp; Formatting:</strong>
                    Generic column labels (e.g., “Unnamed: 2” → “White”) were renamed, and unnecessary ones
                    (such as “MinorText” in the crime data) were dropped. Values that appeared numeric
                    (for example, sales or percentages) were converted from text to numeric form, and
                    dates were standardized to consistent date fields.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Handling Missing &amp; Erroneous Values:</strong>
                    Rows missing critical information (e.g., a missing “Area” name) or containing placeholder
                    entries (e.g., “-”) were removed. In some datasets, unrealistic data (e.g., negative numbers
                    or invalid dates) was also filtered out to maintain accuracy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Wrangling &amp; Transformation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Multiple worksheets or CSV files were combined into a single DataFrame (as seen with
                            the ethnic groups or workless households data by year).</li>
                        <li>Wide data (with many columns) was reorganized into a “long” format for easier grouping,
                            such as in the house prices and unemployment data, where monthly/period columns
                            were converted into a single “Date” or “Year” column.</li>
                        <li>New columns were created—like a “Year” column extracted from sheet names or date strings—
                            to simplify grouping by time period.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Aggregation &amp; Summaries:</strong>
                    Monthly columns were summed to get yearly totals for crime statistics, followed by grouping
                    by categories (e.g., “MajorText”) to identify trends. Average house prices were calculated
                    by gathering daily or monthly data and taking a mean by year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Merging Datasets:</strong>
                    After standardizing names for area and year, multiple DataFrames
                    (e.g., population density, unemployment rates, house prices) were merged using these
                    common fields. A single, comprehensive dataset was produced, containing indicators
                    such as “Workless Household Percentage” or “Avg_house_price” side by side for analysis.
